# Generates the DNSSEC key pair for a zone and writes the
# vault-encrypted private keys into files/dnssec/, where the role picks
# them up. Plaintext keys stay in keys/, which is gitignored. Same
# shape as roles/sshd/scripts/generate_keys.sh, and for the same
# reason: a rebuilt host has to come back with the *same* keys.
#
#   ./generate_dnssec_keys.sh drehtuer.net
#
# Why the keys belong in the repo at all, vault-encrypted, rather than
# being generated on the host: the KSK is what the DS record in the
# parent zone points at. Lose it and the chain of trust breaks until a
# new DS is published at the registrar and has propagated - during
# which the zone is worse than unsigned, it is *bogus*, and validating
# resolvers refuse the answers entirely. Keeping the keys here means a
# rebuild restores the same keys and the DS record never has to change,
# which is the whole point of the repo's disaster-recovery goal.
#
# Two keys per zone, not one:
#
#   KSK  signs only the DNSKEY RRset. Its hash is the DS record in the
#        parent, so rolling it means a registrar change.
#   ZSK  signs everything else. Rolling it is invisible to the parent
#        and needs no registrar involvement, which is the reason for
#        the split.
#
# ECDSAP256SHA256 (algorithm 13) rather than RSA: signatures are a
# fraction of the size, which matters for a protocol that still falls
# back to TCP when a response will not fit, and it is universally
# supported by validating resolvers now.
#
# Re-running is safe. Existing keys are left alone and simply
# re-encrypted, so this cannot silently replace a key that a published
# DS record depends on.
